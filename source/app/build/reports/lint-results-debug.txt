   Explanation for issues of type "UnusedResources":
   Unused resources make applications larger and slow down builds.


   The unused resource check can ignore tests. If you want to include
   resources that are only referenced from tests, consider packaging them in a
   test source set instead.

   You can include test sources in the unused resource check by setting the
   system property lint.unused-resources.include-tests =true, and to exclude
   them (usually for performance reasons), use
   lint.unused-resources.exclude-tests =true.
   ,

   Available options:

   **skip-libraries** (default is true):
   Whether the unused resource check should skip reporting unused resources in libraries.

   Many libraries will declare resources that are part of the library surface; other modules depending on the library will also reference the resources. To avoid reporting all these resources as unused (in the context of a library), the unused resource check normally skips reporting unused resources in libraries. Instead, run the unused resource check on the consuming app module (along with `checkDependencies=true`).

   However, there are cases where you want to check that all the resources declared in a library are used; in that case, you can disable the skip option.

   To configure this option, use a `lint.xml` file with an <option> like this:

   ```xml
   <lint>
       <issue id="UnusedResources">
           <option name="skip-libraries" value="true" />
       </issue>
   </lint>
   ```

   Explanation for issues of type "IconLauncherShape":
   According to the Android Design Guide
   (https://d.android.com/r/studio-ui/designer/material/iconography) your
   launcher icons should "use a distinct silhouette", a "three-dimensional,
   front view, with a slight perspective as if viewed from above, so that
   users perceive some depth."

   The unique silhouette implies that your launcher icon should not be a
   filled square.

   Explanation for issues of type "IconDuplicates":
   If an icon is repeated under different names, you can consolidate and just
   use one of the icons and delete the others to make your application
   smaller. However, duplicated icons usually are not intentional and can
   sometimes point to icons that were accidentally overwritten or accidentally
   not updated.
